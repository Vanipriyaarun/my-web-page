   I am Vanipriya Piramanathan, living in Coventry, UK. I was born and bought up in India. I did my schooling in my hometown, Nattuchalai, a small village near Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. I got so much interest in Mathematics which enabled me to score full marks in my board exams 10th and 12th standard. I have completed my Bachelor's of Engineering in Electronics from Alagappa Chettiyar Engineering College, Karaikudi. After my bachelor's, I joined Masters' in communication system in Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Chennai. During my college days, I involved myself into coding activities and then I stopped it since I changed my domain. Now, I would like to improve my coding skills, so I joined code your future.
Other than my studying activities, I love traveling; I have visited many places in India, in particular the Taj Mahal, Mahabalipuram, Kanyakumari and Dehradun. I visited the United States when my husband got a job over there. We visited many places like Santa Fe, Niagara and Chicago in US. I am a big cricket fan of MS Dhoni and a die-hard supporter of CSK.
